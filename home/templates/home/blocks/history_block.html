                </div>
                <p>DFX Art was founded by two experienced professionals in the field of computer graphics and
                    programming – Stanislav Svarichevsky and Anton Zailinger.</p>
                <p>They first created a computer graphics and computer game programming company back in 1999. That
                    company was called ALS Group and became one of the most successful companies in the international
                    market of cg outsourcing and programming straight from the beginning. The company’s priority was the
                    development and creation of multimedia products and computer graphics for games. In our archive, one
                    can find many of our successful projects in which we participated directly and actively - such as
                    SpellForce, SpellForce II, Aquanox, Knight Shift and many more.</p>
                <p>In 2004, they began taking an interest in the gambling industry and immediately started working with
                    well-known companies such as Unicum (Russia) or Atronic International, which is part of the
                    Gauselmann Group Holding (Germany). From the very first days of our cooperation, we managed to gain
                    the trust and disposition of our new partners, all due to a non-standard approach to fulfilling the
                    task, aimed at the best achievable result. Through intense communication and the study of the
                    production processes directly at the production facilities of our partners as well as the study of
                    their experience and preferences, we not only learned to understand their needs but also their
                    individuality. Because of that and unlike other studios, we were able to find a way to achieve a
                    result above average, whilst keeping our partners’ originality and without restricting them in their
                    wishes. This is proven true by the success of most of our products on the market as well as by
                    numerous awards, which our products have won and are still continuing to win.</p>
                <p>From 2005 on, we started working with the company, Novomatic.</p>
                <p class="hide hide-xl"> This cooperation quickly developed into a close friendship, which led to
                    Novomatic offering us to become a part of their big and highly professional family in 2006. Until
                    2012, we successfully continued to lead the company, ALS Group, increasing our production capacity
                    and quality. However, our entrepreneurial spirit didn’t allow us to stop then and there but rather
                    pushed us to look for new possibilities, new achievements. We were getting bored in the safe and
                    comfortable haven and more and more dreamed of our previous, independent adventures in the stormy
                    and unpredictable sea of entrepreneurship. We therefore decided to leave our beloved haven known as
                    Novomatic in 2012 and, using the priceless experience we had gained while working with them, rushed
                    into a new adventure. Till this day, we are connected by a friendship with the company and are
                    grateful for the warm welcome, the support and, first and foremost, for the priceless experience
                    Novomatic gave us. We are thankful for all the people who wholeheartedly took part in our teamwork
                    and let us learn from them, gain experience and raise our level of professionalism. Those people are
                    primarily President Johan Graf, Thomas Graf, Dir. Presch, Mrs. Neiss, Bartholomäus Czapkiewicz and
                    many, many more. Please accept our sincere gratitude. We would like to thank Mr. Jenns Halle in
                    particular, whose invaluable support, unimpeachable mutual understanding as well as friendship have
                    accompanied us from the very beginning and who passed away too early.</p>
                <p class="hide hide-xl">Once we set sail, our experience and professionalism were highly appreciated by
                    other sailors of the sea, in particular by the company “IGT”. We had already worked with its
                    Austrian office at the dawn of our voyage – starting in 2004 – and have a close yet highly
                    professional relationship with its wonderful and talented people. Working on their projects is
                    always an incredibly exciting and interesting undertaking, which allows us to reveal our full
                    potential and at the same time to continuously improve.</p>
                <p class="hide hide-xl">For some time, we weren’t seeking a full sail, didn’t try to storm too many new
                    bastions. We needed some time to assess the sea and also wanted to spend more time with our
                    families. (We had to raise our children so that they could take over one day. After all, someone has
                    to take our places on the captain’s bridge of our company after we decide to anchor in the quiet
                    harbour known as “retirement”. Even if that anchor seems far, far away at the moment. ) But our
                    children grew up and some of them started mastering our craft. And that means that we finally can
                    command the crew: “Raise all sails! Full speed ahead!”.</p>
                <p class="hide hide-xl">As of today, our experience in the field of gambling game production is
                    unrivalled, our potential undeniable. This applies to both land based slot machines as well as
                    online casino games (iGaming). The experience and knowhow accumulated over the years and in the
                    course of many projects enable us to meet high-quality requirements and solve tasks of any
                    difficulty. Even if it requires learning “on the fly”. </p>
                <p class="hide hide-xl">We have developed a very flexible way of working with our clients. For each, we
                    provide a customised team, depending on their needs and preferences. </p>
                <p class="hide hide-xl">The system we have introduced to our company in order to quickly recruit skilled
                    professionals has proven itself incredibly effective, enabling us to increase our production
                    capacity within a very short time if needed in order to meet all requirements. Because of that, our
                    productive capacities are located where the greatest potential of first-class specialists lies -
                    both artists and programmers. One of the main centres is, without doubt, Saint Petersburg, Russia.
                    It has more than 7 different universities preparing graphic specialists and many universities
                    preparing programmers, and they are famous all over the world.</p>
                <p class="hide hide-xl">Practice has shown that the simplest and most convenient way to start
                    cooperation with a new partner is to do of a pilot project. This usually is one small game. We can
                    offer both – games for Slot machines as well as online games (iGaming). Many clients like to combine
                    both, meaning that we first develop a game for the slot machine and adapt it for the online version
                    later. It is also possible to start working solely with the graphics and to move onto complete
                    projects later, once you have got to know us better. This approach is also quite popular and proves
                    itself as it gives you the opportunity to get to know us without having to take any risks. </p>
